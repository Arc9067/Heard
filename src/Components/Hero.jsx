            I initiated the $HEARD project with the understanding that being
            heard is a fundamental human need. Throughout history, individuals
            have made transformative changes by simply having their voices
            acknowledged and others listening. Anyone and everyone can make a
            difference. $HEARD is a 0/0 tax token and without pre-sale,
            airdrops, team tokens, or tax farming. This project aims to empower
            the community to be $HEARD and collectively push as one voice.
